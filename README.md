# Education-Inequality
The purpose of this repository is to explore the inequality of education in the U.S. More descriptively, we will determine whether or not certain socioeconomic factors affect SAT and ACT scores of high school students.

# Data
This project utilizes two data sets EdGap_data.xlsx and ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv. The primary data set is the EdGap data set from EdGap.org. This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from the National Center for Education Statistics.
